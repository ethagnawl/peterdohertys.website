                <section><h2 id="glancing-at-python-through-ruby-tinted-glasses">Glancing at Python through Ruby-Tinted Glasses</h2>
<p>I recently shipped the largest, most complex Python project I’ve ever worked on. I’ve written lots of Python scripts and worked on a few Flask/Django projects, but it had been a few years and those had all been simple REST APIs. This project was a CMS which allowed admins to produce and publish static web pages to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)/Google App Engine (GAE). In contrast, the majority of my development experience over the last few years (er decade, but who’s counting?) has been with Ruby/Rails and AWS/Heroku.</p>
<p>Below you’ll find my personal pros/cons list and some misc takes which attempt to summarize my thoughs and feelings about the Python/GAE/etc. ecosystem. It’s possible/likely that I’ve overlooked Python/Django/GAE/etc. features and/or am just wrong about some things, so I’d be very happy to be corrected by anyone taking the time to read this (PR, comment, whatever you like). For reasons which were out of my control, it’s also worth noting that I was using older versions of Python (2.7) and Django (1.11) so some of the following may no longer be relevant.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<h4 id="community">Community</h4>
<p>The Python community is welcoming, helpful and encouraging. In particular, I greatly appreciated and valued my interactions with the Djangae community (on GitHub and the mailing list), /r/djangolearning and Stack Overflow.</p>
<h5 id="rtfm">RTFM</h5>
<p>The Python community links directly to source code <em>much</em> more frequently than the Ruby community does when working through problems, discussing libraries, etc. This is great and forces you to become intimately familiar with the libraries you are using. There are many possible reasons that the Ruby community doesn’t do this, but I wonder how much of it is rooted in Ruby’s (historical/perceived) use of metaprogramming or “magic”? Early versions of Rails used lots of metaprogramming and it wouldn’t necessarily be helpful to reference source when discussing solutions to application level concerns and it’s possible that this has bled out into the larger community, but that’s just a hunch. On the flip side, I’ve found that the Ruby community favors tutorials, examples and tests, which are valuable in their own right. Forced to choose, I’d say that looking at the source code is preferential, but the Python community could do to include more examples/tutorials.</p>
<h4 id="python">Python</h4>
<h5 id="behave">Behave</h5>
<p><a href="https://github.com/behave/behave">behave</a> is a Cucumber-like BDD tool for Python and, for the most part (see cons entry below), it <em>Just Worked</em>. I was able to write useful, exploratory, high-level, executable specs and found it easy to stub out collaborating services (GAE Users, Cloud Datastore, etc.) The OS integration was also very tight and Headless Chrome makes for a fast and, generally, fantastic execution environment.</p>
<h5 id="flake-8">Flake 8</h5>
<p>The flake8 linter is very helpful. It prevents useless arguments about coding styles and can help you catch defects before you leave your text editor. The <a href="https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8">flake8 Vim plugin</a> works well and regularly saved me from making silly mistakes.</p>
<h5 id="multiple-inheritance">Multiple Inheritance</h5>
<p>Multiple inheritance is very powerful and I wish I’d leaned on it more heavily during this project. An early version of the project I’d worked on had an explicit God Class which used multiple inheritance to compose its relations and I, naively, unwound this and made the relations more … relational. In retrospect, this was a mistake and, since we were using Cloud Data Storage (GCP’s NoSQL offering and Djangae’s default database back-end), I should have just run with a model hierarchy which mapped cleanly to the object/document structure of our database.</p>
<h4 id="django">Django</h4>
<h5 id="class-based-views">Class Based Views</h5>
<ul>
<li>Django’s <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/class-based-views/">CBVs</a> abstract most common CRUD behavior from Django views (Rails controllers) and are easy to customize and extend. If I’d have followed the Django conventions (e.g. model/template locations) more closely, CBVs would have been a drop-in for many of my view actions. Rails doesn’t provide an analogue (there are gems like <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">simple_form</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer">trailblazer</a> (possibly abandoned?) and others which do offer similar constructs) and I’m now I’m wishing it did. (To be fair, Rails’ scaffold/generators will generate controller methods that provide similar behavior, but it’d be nice if those methods were available through a library or via a uniform interface – generated code requires maintenance and makes bugs more likely than the CBV approach does.)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="admin">Admin</h5>
<p>The Django Admin panel is very powerful and, in many cases, can preclude the need for a custom UI/client app: You define your database and models and it provides all of the CRUD and GUI glue you could hope for. We’d originally planned to use Django Admin as our client UI on this project, but our UX workflow became complicated enough that we quickly ran up against the limitations of Django Admin’s customization options. (See related cons entry below.)</p>
<h5 id="auth">Auth</h5>
<ul>
<li>Django’s contrib.auth module provides a user model, (basic) authentication, groups and permissions out of the box and it’s equivalent to Rails bundling Devise and CanCan(Can). IMO, this is a great choice and would save <em>lots</em> of time, effort and copying/pasting if Rails would mainline these third-party gems. I haven’t gone back to look through Django’s history, but it’d be interesting to see if these features started life outside of Django and were merged in once they became the de facto patterns or if they were always core concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="template-filters">Template Filters</h5>
<p>Django ships with many useful <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/templates/builtins/">template filters</a> (AKA view helpers). Some standouts are: <code>autoescape</code>, <code>firstof</code> and <code>lorem</code>.</p>
<h4 id="djangae">Djangae</h4>
<ul>
<li>Djangae is <em>extremely</em> useful and makes getting a <a href="https://github.com/potatolondon/djangae-scaffold">new</a> or existing Django project up and running on GAE pretty painless. The documentation is great, the community is very supportive and, for the most part, everything Just Worked. Djangae provides gobs of utility: installation and configuration of the Google Cloud SDK and seamless integration with the GC SDK and its various services (Cloud Datastore, Task Queue, GA users, etc.) from within your Django app. It’s still technically in beta, but it’s very solid and, IMO, that shouldn’t stop anyone from using it in their next project.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="google-cloud-services">Google Cloud Services</h4>
<h5 id="amz-headers">AMZ Headers</h5>
<p>Google Cloud Services respect some/most/all? AWS (<code>amz</code>) headers, which i s generous and can make transitioning to GCS simple.</p>
<h5 id="cloud-function-http-triggers">Cloud Function HTTP Triggers</h5>
<p>Cloud Function HTTP triggers are fantastic. At last check, AWS Lambda did not do this and required users to spin up an API Gateway to achieve similar behavior – I’d imagine this is the most popular/desired trigger and it makes so much sense to provide it by default.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<h4 id="python-1">Python</h4>
<h5 id="self">Self</h5>
<p>In my opinion, one of Python’s biggest shortcomings – especially when using libraries/frameworks which require OOP – is having to explicitly pass the <code>self</code> parameter to methods. This is clunky and it’s too easy to forget to do this. Python 3 should have fixed this, while making other breaking changes, by providing something similar to Ruby, JavaScript, Java, et al’s implicit self/this/that/whatever. Yes, you get used to having to pass self to <em>every single instance method</em> and yes, you could use tooling to do it automatically, but why is that necessary? GVR provides some justification for this approach in <a href="https://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html">this</a> old blog post and likely elsewhere, but the dynamic/metaprogramming edge cases could surely be handled in other ways.</p>
<h5 id="tuples">Tuples</h5>
<ul>
<li>Tuples are great, but their (sometime?) required trailing commas are not. For example, when passing optargs to a function or creating a tuple with one member, the trailing comma is required (e.g. <code>(1,)</code>). This seems to be required in order to distinguish the tuple from a set of function arguments or parenthesis used to emphasize evaluation. This would be fine, if it were the case for all datatype literals (list, dict, etc.), but this requirement only applies to tuples. Again, this seems like it could have easily been resolved by Python 3.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h5>
<p>Significant whitespace makes programs legible and precludes the need for closing tags/blocks/etc. Unfortunately, they very often cause programs to run afoul of (the excellent) flake8 linter. I found myself regularly running over 80 columns as the result of nested dictionaries whose shape/key names were dictated by a third-party API. Granted, I didn’t spend too much time looking into potential solutions, but IIRC, there is no way to tell the flake8 vim plugin to ignore long lines.</p>
<h5 id="environment">Environment</h5>
<p>Getting a Python environment setup is still a little confusing and, despite the Python community’s <em>there’s only one way to do it</em> mantra, there are <em>many</em> ways to setup a Python development environment, install dependencies, create workspaces, etc. FWIW, we settled on virtualenv, pyenv and pip, but pipenv also looks promising.</p>
<h5 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h5>
<p>Pip feels a bit half baked, compared to Bundler/RubyGems. As far as I can tell, pip doesn’t create a lockfile, there’s no way to add different environments (e.g. test, development, production) in a single file and requirements.txt is relatively unstructured and doesn’t provide much/any metadata to editors/IDEs. (IIRC, pipenv does address these issues and is one reason I’ll consider it in the future. )</p>
<h5 id="missing-build-tooling">Missing build tooling</h5>
<p>Python doesn’t have a build tool (akin to Ruby’s Rake) provided by its standard library. There is a tool called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Paver/">Paver</a>, which offers a similar feature set, but doesn’t seem to be very widely used.</p>
<h5 id="behave-badly">Behave (badly)</h5>
<p>As mentioned above, behave is an excellent BDD library. Unfortunately, I was unable to control its output levels as the library’s documentation claimed I’d be able to (CLI and config file). This resulted in TONS of output (mostly Djangae warnings, IIRC) when the tests were run and made it very difficult to follow along or see debug information. Running individual tests helped, but still resulted in multiple screens full of useless output.</p>
<h5 id="unicode">Unicode</h5>
<p>Python 2.x strings are not Unicode. Casting to/from Unicode must be done explicitly and with care. If care is not taken, user input can/will result in parsing errors and program crashes. (Go on, ask me how I know …)</p>
<p>Python 3’s strings <em>are</em> Unicode and this is hailed as one of the defining features of the new version. It’s worth noting, again, that this project used Python 2 for $REASONS and, since Python 2 will be EOL on 1/1/2020, this problem is not (as much of) a concern going forward.</p>
<h4 id="django-1">Django</h4>
<h5 id="missing-codefile-generator">Missing code/file generator</h5>
<p>A Rails CLI convenience I sorely missed was <code>rails generate ...</code> which can be used to automatically generate controllers/views/routes/migrations, etc. Its event lifecycle can be tapped into by third-party libraries to generate tests, fixtures, documentation, etc. This prevents users from having to copy code from the documentation to get started and prevents users from having to copy code between files when creating new views, models, etc.</p>
<p>To be fair, manage.py <em>may</em> provide some of this behavior (I believe it can create/run migrations), but it doesn’t appear to be nearly as comprehensive. Presumably there are third-party plugins/scripts which automate these common actions, but it would be nice if Django provided something more robust. Also, as mentioned above, CBVs do sort of address this concern, but when you do actually need concrete classes, it’s nice to have them created in a uniform way.</p>
<h5 id="console">Console</h5>
<p>Django missing rails console analogue (need to manually import models, etc.)</p>
<h5 id="application-file-structure">Application File Structure</h5>
<p>Compared to Rails, Django is very unopinionated about application file structure; naming conventions and seems to encourage (at least to start) keeping multiple classes (e.g. views) in a single file. This is <em>okay</em>, but reminds me of a problem I’ve seen in every Sinatra/Express project I’ve worked on, wherein every team has to reinvent the wheel when breaking large files with multiple classes into their component pieces: Do related classes (model, views, routing) live in an app-level object directory (e.g. app/foo/[view,model].py) or in a directory structure based on their base class (e.g. app/models/foo.py)? How are the files named? Are they suffixed/prefixed? etc.</p>
<h5 id="customizing-django-admin">Customizing Django Admin</h5>
<p>As mentioned above, Django Admin is extremely useful, but there is an upper limit on how much you can customize it. This is to be expected, but it’s particularly frustrating because it gets you 80% of the way there. Perhaps there could be a place for a more fleshed out event/hook system or an admin API (something akin to Headless WordPress?) that’d make it easy to bolt on a custom front-end?</p>
<h5 id="asset-pipeline">Asset Pipeline</h5>
<p>Django doesn’t ship with anything akin to Rails’ Asset Pipeline. The Asset Pipeline has been the subject of lots of debate, but it does <em>Do The Right Thing</em> in most cases and provides tons of utility for free. There are libraries that you can use to have Django do stylesheet preprocessing, asset fingerprinting, etc. but you need to spend time researching, integrating and supporting them.</p>
<h5 id="seed-database">Seed Database</h5>
<p>Django does not have an analogue for Rails <code>db:seed</code> Rake task. There are libraries that can be added in order to provide this functionality, but this seems like a pretty obvious miss.</p>
<h4 id="google-cloud-services-1">Google Cloud Services</h4>
<h5 id="config">Config</h5>
<p>GAE seem to encourage placing configuration in files, as opposed to using environment variables. (Heroku makes it very easy to set ENV vars from the CLI and the GUI.) IMO, this is very undesirable and can lead to bad behavior (e.g. committing/pushing sensitive credentials) and complicates deployments.</p>
<h5 id="contextual-search">Contextual Search</h5>
<p>I found it to be very difficult to find contextual search results when doing web searches for Google’s cloud offerings. Granted, I don’t use Google’s search engine, which <em>may</em> be biased towards these results, but trying to find documentation for “cloud function” or “cloud datastore” using DuckDuckGo proved to be very frustrating.</p>
<h5 id="missing-documentation">Missing Documentation</h5>
<p>The documentation for the various Google Cloud Platform offerings seems to be lacking and, again, is hard to search for (see previous point). For instance, I was never able to figure out how to make a GCS object publicly visible <em>while</em> uploading it using a signed URL. (The only alternatives were to force the user to make a second request in order to get a new signed URL and then use that URL in order to make the object public or just make the entire bucket public, which is what we were, luckily, able to do.) I was also unable to find a conclusive answer for how long the timeout was for HTTP requests running in background tasks. It’s possible that these were just edge cases, but I saw comments on Stack Overflow and elsewhere while searching for these answers that seemed to indicate that other developers were used to seeing these sorts of omissions.</p>
<h5 id="hosting-a-static-website">Hosting a Static Website</h5>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t serve a static site from a Google Cloud Storage bucket, like you can an AWS S3 bucket. In order to do this, you need to front bucket with GAE proxy web application which routes the requests, reads the bucket contents, generates a response, etc.. This seems like a glaring omission, but we were unable to find a solution that didn’t involve standing up a proxy. Hopefully this is something Google will address in the future, because it’s a deal breaker for me – S3 more/less does this by default.</p>
<h4 id="misc">Misc</h4>
<ul>
<li>Python, Ruby and friends <em>all</em> feel sloppy after using Elm for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180928051336/https://www.intelfuturequiz.com/">a non-trivial project</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethagnawl/rust-c-ffi-demo">experimenting with Rust</a>. Python 3.5 added support for type hints, which is a step in the right direction and may help make applications more robust, but I don’t know if that feature has or will see much adoption.</li>
